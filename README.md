# GABA-Memory

If we want to study how the brain works, we have to simulate realistic neurons on large scales. Thus we must compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Hodgkin and Huxley's neurons are on one extreme. They’re very accurate, but we can only simulate a handful of these neurons since it’s so computationally expensive. On the other hand, we have integrate-and-fire neurons. These are computationally effective, but it’s unrealisticly simple — thus not able to reproduce rich spiking and bursting that’s in real neurons.
